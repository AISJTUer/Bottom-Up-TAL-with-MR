![avatar](/framework.png)

# Update

2020-12-02 We also provide a pytorch implementation for proposed Mutual Regularization losses in [Mutual_Regularization_Loss.py](https://github.com/PeisenZhao/Bottom-Up-TAL-with-MR/blob/master/Mutual_Regularization_Loss.py).



# Environment Configuration

1. The code is based on tensorflow 1.5 and python3.5
2. Some required python packages:
	tqdm, matplotlib, pickle, json, 

# Data Preparation

We use the features provided by paper **CMCS-Temporal-Action-Localization** [1].
Download and use *merge_feature.py* in *./data* folder to pre-process the features.
